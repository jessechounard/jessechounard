Heya! I'm Jesse Chounard. I'm a dad, a husband, and a lover of video games and technology. I've been excited about programming since I got a chance to play with BASIC on a Commodore 64 when I was eight years old. I enjoy working in C++, C#, and Rust, and lately I've been focusing on learning TypeScript and the Serverless Framework with Amazon Web Services.

I'm hoping to become more active in open source projects in 2022.

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [CAVA](https://cava.com/).
