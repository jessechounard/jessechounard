## Heya! I'm Jesse Chounard.

I'm a dad, a husband, and a lover of video games and technology. I've been excited about programming since I got a chance to play with BASIC on a Commodore 64 when I was eight years old. I love learning new programming languages and can't seem to stop buying books on new languages and technologies. My current favorite languages are Go, Rust, and TypeScript. I've also used C, C++, C#, CSS, Dart, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Scala, Swift, plus a handful of assembly languages.

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [CAVA](https://cava.com/).

Not actively looking for a new gig, but here's [my resume](https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://github.com/jessechounard/jessechounard/raw/cf8ff21d94b504a8bf9c3737690f846adab8b10f/resume/resume_jessechounard.pdf&embedded=true).
