Heya! I'm Jesse Chounard. I'm a dad, a husband, and a lover of video games and technology. I've been excited about programming since I got a chance to play with BASIC on a Commodore 64 when I was eight years old. I love learning new programming languages and can't seem to stop buying books on new languages and technologies. My current favorite languages are Rust and TypeScript, and I've started experimenting with Go. I've also used C, C++, C#, CSS, Dart, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Scala, Swift, plus a handful of different assembly languages.

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [CAVA](https://cava.com/).
